# Jamaican Grill House Restaurant Page

A page for a local restaurant.

## Description


This project is built using vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. The entire project is rendered using DOM maniuplation, the only HTML is the boilerplate. This project implements ES6 modules to create a single page app.


### What could be improved

The finalised menu items have not been agreed on by the business owner yet. I would also like to include an embedded Google Maps in a later version
